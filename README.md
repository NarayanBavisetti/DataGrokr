# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# To run this application in your local system run:-

### `npm install`

It will download all the node modules required to run this react application.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Run this in the same directory.

### In the termainal

Type `cd server`.


### `npm install`

It will download all the node modules required to run this application.

### `npm run dev`

This will start the server side using nodemon. Else you can simply run `node index.js`

**Note:
In this application I have used MySql workbench as my database with my local username and passwords. 
Please check you details and edit accordingly in the index.js folder from line 13 to 15.**

This is a basic app in which the data can be saved in the local storage or mysqlworkbench. It uses react in frontend and nodejs and mysql in the backend. The docker files are also created in this app.
